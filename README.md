<h1>Research Questions</h1><BR>
  What are the the different clusters (lineages) of COVID-19 strains? <BR>
  Which of these lineages (if any) are most correlated with outcome severity?<BR>

  <h1>CONCLUSIONS</H1>
  The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak can be curtailed with:
The distance between lineages falls between (0.00 - 0.02) and is insufficient to consider them as different genotypes.
There is no significant difference in the association between each of the lineages and severity of outcome.
